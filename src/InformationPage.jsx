        <h3>The Project</h3>
        <p>
          Task Master is a feature-rich task management application built with
          React. Seamlessly manage your tasks and lists, customize colors, and
          enjoy a seamless single-page application experience. Stay organized
          with Task Master.
        </p>
        <p>
          Task Master was developed as an assigment for my course in React at
          Chas Academy. The goal was to implement as many React features as
          possible to make a seemless SPA-application. Following the React
          philosophy, I've divided up the application is many re-usable
          components, added hooks such as useContext, useState and useEffect to
          seemlessly update Tasks, Lists and color preferences, and store them
          in the browsers localStorge for better UI/UX.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using various react packages including browser router, the SPA is
          developed with browser history and navigation in mind. Each task, list
          and page has its own unique URL-endpoint.
        </p>
        <h3>Tasks</h3>
