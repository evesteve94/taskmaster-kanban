## The Project

- Task Master is a feature-rich task management application built with
  React. Seamlessly manage your tasks and lists, customize colors, and
  enjoy a seamless single-page application experience. Stay organized
  with Task Master.

- Task Master was developed as an assigment for my course in React at
  Chas Academy. The goal was to implement as many React features as
  possible to make a seemless SPA-application. Following the React
  philosophy, I've divided up the application is many re-usable
  components, added hooks such as useContext, useState and useEffect to
  seemlessly update Tasks, Lists and color preferences, and store them
  in the browsers localStorge for better UI/UX.

- Using various react packages including browser router, the SPA is
  developed with browser history and navigation in mind. Each task, list
  and page has its own unique URL-endpoint.
